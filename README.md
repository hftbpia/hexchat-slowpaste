# hexchat-pasteslow
<br><br>
requires hexchat-lua<br>
requires lua5.3<br>
add .lua file to directory /home/username/.config/hexchat/addons/<br>
run hexchat, select windows/plugins then load pasteslow.lua (or whatever you named it)<br>
use: /pasteslow filename<br>
will paste in whatever channel you ran it from<br>
you can change the paste speed here: local delay = 3.5 -- Delay in seconds<br>
<br><br>
I make no claim to anything other than here is some text and it works for me.<br>
